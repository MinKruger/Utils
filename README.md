# Utils - My junk folder

Repository intended to keep:

- Files containing html/css/JS components that can be leveraged in the future.

- Sql scripts

- Backend solutions for problems that I found in codes that I worked on and that I can use again to correct errors

- Error documentation that may not happen again, but if it does, I'll have a tutorial teaching how to fix it

- And a few more things that I won't be able to specify right now

---

## Organization

It will be separated into three main folders: _backend_, _frontend_ and _general_.

The sql scripts and documentation are saved in the _general_ folder.

**TODO: don't forget that this folder exists and actually put things in it in the future**
